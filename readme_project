Project title: Characterising transmission parameters of SARS-CoV-2 in a peri-urban setting in Mozambique using population-based surveillance and a high-throughput sero-assay (Africover)

Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04442165

Participating Organisations:
Instituut voor Tropische Geneeskunde (ITM), Belgium (PI Marc-Alain Widdowson) 
Instituto Nacional de Saúde (INS), Mozambique (PI Ivalda Macicame)

Household data and sample collection: 15/12/2020 to 15/01/2022 (with data completion until 30/04/2022)

Project summary: 
Approach: We conducted population-based surveillance in a Demographic Health Surveillance System (HDSS) of 16,500 people in a peri-urban neighbourhood of Maputo, Mozambique. We collected clinical information and respiratory specimens from ill persons during biweekly household visits and complement with data from local clinics.  We conducted a serosurvey of a random selection of 1450 persons (<18, 18-50y, 50+) at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. 
Primary Objectives
•	Estimate the attack rate, secondary infection rate, serial interval, and the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 infection in peri-urban Maputo
•	Estimate the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, and tease out the role these play in transmission
•	Estimate the incidence rate of infection, disease, hospitalization and mortality, over a 12 month period
•	Validate a high-throughput serologic Luminex SARS-CoV-2 serology assay and compare its performance to that of  two validated commercially available serologic assays in sSA
Secondary Objectives
•	Identify risk factors for infection and for asymptomatic or clinical presentation,
•	Validate the use of dried blood spots in SARS-CoV-2 serologic surveys
•	Measure antibody titers over time and analyze the correlation between anti-coronavirus (endemic coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2) antibody titers and reinfection 
•	Assess the individual and community uptake of measures aimed to reduce transmission and assess barriers to uptake and effect on transmission.
An existing Luminex platform was used to test dried blood spots (DBS) collected within the sero-survey rounds.
